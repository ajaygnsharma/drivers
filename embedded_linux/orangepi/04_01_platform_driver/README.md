## Device tree

So the device tree that is compiled is located in
/home/ajay/dev/rpi/buildroot/output/build/linux-custom/arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm2708-rpi-b.dts

It refers to

`#include "bcm2708.dtsi"`

`#include "bcm2708-rpi.dtsi"`

These files are useful

This SOC is later on named as BCM2835. Dont be confused. They are one and only one thing.
