led.c
------
command - led 1 on

data = XXXX_XX00
data = XXXX_XX01

Data is written to the device.
/sys/bus/i2c/devices/0-0060/ls2 <- xxxx_xx01


pca9532.c
----------
pca9532_store() called.

- finds out the device attribute
- finds out the client for the device
- converts the value from string to hex.
- calls i2c_smbus_write_byte_data

i2c-core.c
-----------
i2c_smbus_write_byte_data().
- calls i2c_smbus_xfer.

i2c_smbus_xfer().
- calls i2c_smbus_xfer_emulated.

i2c_smbus_xfer_emulated().
- ?


i2c_algorithm
===============
.master_xfer = lpc2xxx_i2c_xfer

i2c_lpc2xxx.c
--------------
- calls lpc2xxx_i2c_xfer.

lpc2xxx_i2c_xfer() is called.
- calls lpc2xxx_i2c_execute_msg.

lpc2xxx_i2c_execute_msg().
- calls lpc2xxx_i2c_do_action.
This sets the control register with the new value.



NOTE:
The (I2C hw block in the LPC2468, master device) i2c-lpc2xxx.c is registered as an adaptor.
The (led dimmer on the I2C bus, slave device) pca9532.c is registered as a client.
