# uClinux Device Drivers
This repository contains uClinux Device drivers for temperature sensors. The board used is LPC2468 ARM7 based from Embedded Artists at [www.embeddedartists.com](https://www.embeddedartists.com/products/lpc2468-developers-kit/)

 There are two sensors: 
 1. TMP102 - This supports I2C protocol. 
 2. TMP36 - This needs to be interfaced to an ADC MCP3002 which supports SPI protocol.
 
 #### Why is this useful?
Because someone can create this layout and interface to a Embedded Linux board.
